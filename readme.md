# Updater

Updater _(working title, final name may change)_ is a command line application
that can update popular third party software on Windows operating systems
easily.

More to come soon.

## Getting the source code

Get the source directly from GitHub by cloning the Git repository (e.g. in Git
Bash) and change to the directory after the repository is completely cloned:

    git clone https://github.com/striezel/updater.git updater
    cd updater

That's it, you should now have the current source code of updater on your
machine.
